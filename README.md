Chase's Hangman Game:

My project is a Hangman game, used to play Hangman

My Hangman Game:
Allows user input to create a word of their choosing 
Creates an array of potential answers
Keeps track of input guesses and prevents you from making the same guess twice
tells you you've lost when you guess wrong 8 times.

Tech Used: 
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

Use instructions:
Go to the github website
Enter a word of your choice into the bar
Have someone else guess the word by inputting their guessed letter, one at a time, into the input bar
Have Fun!!! or else

Improvements:

If you have any suggestions, please help me!
