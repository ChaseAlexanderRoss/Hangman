        Eight steps to death is a thematic reinvention of the game Hangman. In this game, instead of escaping only a noose,
        you'll be escaping the Grimm Reaper, Death. Death is a bit slow though, and needs you to stumble over your footing a few
        times in order to catch up. As Death slowly creeps closer, will you be able to outrun and outwit him?
