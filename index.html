        Hangman is a two player word guessing game. Player one picks a word, and player two will try to guess it. The game is called Hangman because, traditionally, as the game is played, player one will draw a man hanging from a noose as player 2 guesses incorrectly, and player two loses if the drawing is completed. Player two wins if they can guess the word before the drawing is finished.
